# Random Sewing Messages Generator

### Project Goals
Build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
To make my program truly random, the message that it outputs is made up of three different pieces of data.
As I love sewing, I have created a program that will tell you which kind of gargament to sew.

### Project Objectives:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer
